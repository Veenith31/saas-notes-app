Of course. A great README is essential for any project. Based on all the features we've implemented, here is a comprehensive and professionally formatted README.md file for your project, Notely.

You can replace the entire content of your existing README.md file with the markdown code below.

Notely - Multi-Tenant SaaS Notes Application
Notely is a secure, multi-tenant SaaS application designed to allow different companies (tenants) to manage their notes and users in a completely isolated environment. The application features role-based access control, subscription plans with feature gating, and a complete RESTful API for note management.

 Key Features
Multi-Tenancy Architecture: Securely supports multiple tenants (e.g., Acme and Globex) with strict data isolation, ensuring no data is ever shared between companies.

Authentication & Authorization: Implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control:

Admin Role: Can manage subscriptions (upgrade/downgrade).

Member Role: Can only perform CRUD operations on notes.

Subscription Plans & Feature Gating:

Free Plan: Tenants are limited to a maximum of 3 notes.

Pro Plan: Tenants have access to unlimited notes.

Admins can instantly upgrade or downgrade their subscription.

Full CRUD API for Notes: A complete set of API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes, all with enforced tenant isolation.

Modern Frontend: A responsive and user-friendly interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, providing a seamless user experience.

Vercel Deployment: The entire application, both frontend and backend API, is hosted on Vercel for optimal performance and scalability.

 Tech Stack
This project is built with a modern, type-safe, and scalable technology stack:

Framework: Next.js (with App Router)

Database: Vercel Postgres (powered by Neon)

ORM: Prisma

Authentication: NextAuth.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Deployment: Vercel

 Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18.18 or later)

npm or yarn

A Vercel account for database hosting

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Veenith31/saas-notes-app.git
cd saas-notes-app
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Set up the database on Vercel:

Create a new Vercel Postgres database from your Vercel dashboard.

Connect it to your project.

Pull the environment variables to your local machine by running:

Bash

vercel env pull .env
This will create a .env file with your DATABASE_URL and other necessary keys.

Run the database migration:
This command will set up your database schema based on the Prisma model.

Bash

npx prisma migrate dev
Seed the database with test data:
This will create the default tenants and test user accounts.

Bash

npx prisma db seed
Run the development server:

Bash

npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application.

 Multi-Tenancy Architecture
This project implements a multi-tenancy architecture using a single database with a shared schema. Data isolation is enforced by a tenantId foreign key on the User and Note tables.

Every database query for notes or users is filtered by the tenantId of the currently authenticated user. This ensures that a user from one tenant (e.g., Acme) can never access data belonging to another tenant (e.g., Globex). This approach is simple to manage and cost-effective for this scale of application.

 API Endpoints
All endpoints are protected and require authentication.

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/health	Health check endpoint.
POST	/api/notes	Create a new note.
GET	/api/notes	List all notes for the current tenant.
GET	/api/notes/:id	Retrieve a specific note.
PUT	/api/notes/:id	Update a specific note.
DELETE	/api/notes/:id	Delete a specific note.
POST	/api/tenants/:slug/upgrade	(Admin only) Upgrades tenant to Pro plan.
POST	/api/tenants/:slug/downgrade	(Admin only) Downgrades tenant to Free plan.
